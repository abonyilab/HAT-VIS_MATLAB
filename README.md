# Introduction
The HAT-VIS toolbox is developed in MATLAB R2023a. The toolbox includes elements for hypergraph visualization including the representation of vertex similarity. HAT-VIS can be utilized individually and also as an additional function embedded within the HAT: Hypergraph Analysis Toolbox [1] to complement the analysis tool.

The developed tool can also function individually and be utilized separately.

The structure and workflow of the proposed tool are illustrated in Figure below and its features are characterized as follows: 
* Calculates vertex similarity and distance matrix based on the input incidence matrix
* Apply multidimensional scaling
* Visualize hypergraphs based on vertex similarity
